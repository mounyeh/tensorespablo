    NOTE TO USERS 
 
    The code in this directory is not officially part of ITK.
 
    This code is covered by the LGPL (different from the ITK license). A
    more complete license text can be found below.  In short, you may use
    this code in commercial products, but if you make changes directly to
    the vtkFlRenderWindowInteractor source, these changes must also be made
    available to the public as LGPL code.  Please read the COPYING.LGPL file
    for more details.
 
    That being said, the code has been included in ITK release given that it
    is extremely useful for developing applications involving FLTK and VTK.
    It basically allows one to perform VTK renderings to FLTK windows, with
    full interaction controllable from VTK or FLTK.
 
    Several of the examples provided in ITK take advantage of the nice
    functionalities of this class.
